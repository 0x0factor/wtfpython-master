## Generating the notebook

- Expand the relative links in README.md to absolute ones
- Remove the TOC in README.md (because Google colab generates its own anyway)
- Reorder the examples, so that the ones that work are upfront.
- Run the `notebook_generator.py`, it will generate a notebook named `wtf.ipynb`
- Revert the README.md changes (optional)
